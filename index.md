I’m a data reporter at *The Detroit News*, where I’ve covered issues like racial disparities in drug overdose deaths, immigration enforcement in Michigan, and Detroit’s 2025 mayoral election. 

Before coming to Detroit, I reported for [*The Wall Street Journal*](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/ben-warren) and researched housing discrimination with the [Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/consumer-finance-data/racial-covenants).

I’m an alum of [Dickinson College](https://www.dickinson.edu/news/article/5128/student_snapshot_ben_warren_25) in Carlisle, PA, where I studied data analytics and history.

**Data Reporter,** *The Detroit News*

*[Jun 2025 - Present]*

I’m a one-man data team at The News, balancing original reporting with ad-hoc data analysis and data visualization to support reporters around the newsroom. So far, I’ve:

- Exposed racial disparities in drug overdose deaths across Michigan;
- Found that most people ICE’s Detroit field office arrested had no prior criminal record; and
- Revamped our election reporting system, automating the vote collection process with Python scripts and displaying results on our website in clean Flourish graphics.

I’ve occasionally appeared on the radio to talk about my work, including Michigan Public Radio’s Stateside program and JR Afternoon on WJR

**Data Reporting Intern,** *The Wall Street Journal*

*[Jun 2024 - Aug 2024]*

As part of the Journal's data team, I collaborated with reporters across the investigations, health & science, and politics teams on analytics-driven reporting. There, I…

- Built a database of cannabis testing records, then analyzed and visualized the data in R for a page one investigation,
- performed multivariate regressions on demographic and voting data in Python to identify political divides among Black and Hispanic voters, and
- wrote Python scripts to gather deleted tweets for a major project on Elon Musk's political transformation.

I prepared for the job with a one-week intensive business reporting training from the Dow Jones News Fund.

**Data & Communications Intern,** Center for Sustainability Education

*[Jan 2024 - May 2024]*

I worked on sustainability projects at Dickinson through campus outreach and effective data communication. I coordinated and edited CSE's online newsletter, created [data-driven graphics](https://www.dickinson.edu/sustainabilitydashboard) for CSE projects, and served as a liaison to the greater campus community.

**News Editor**, *The Dickinsonian*

*[Jan 2023 - May 2024]*

I managed the [news section of our student-run weekly](https://thedickinsonian.com/category/news/), editing articles and overseeing layout for print production in Adobe InDesign. I also produced the paper's online newsletter for >200 consistent readers using MailChimp.

As a reporter, I've written extensively on issues of [race](https://thedickinsonian.com/news/2024/02/22/cheerleaders-file-bias-report/) and [gender](https://thedickinsonian.com/news/2022/11/03/presidential-working-group-releases-suggested-changes-to-sexual-misconduct-policy/) on campus and constructed visualizations for data-driven stories on [drug/alcohol use](https://thedickinsonian.com/news/2022/10/08/annual-safety-report-liquor-and-drug-violations-down-from-pre-covid-levels/), [sexual assault](https://thedickinsonian.com/news/2022/09/15/title-ix-cases-increase-on-campus/), and [gender pay equity](https://thedickinsonian.com/news/2023/04/06/faculty-pay-analysis-finds-no-gender-inequity-some-profs-unconvinced/).

**Writing Tutor/Researcher**, Norman M. Eberly Multilingual Writing C*enter*

*[Aug 2022 - May 2024]*

I tutored in the college's [Multilingual Writing Center](https://www.dickinson.edu/homepage/120/writing_program) and served as a [writing associate](https://www.dickinson.edu/info/20158/writing_program/557/writing_associates_program) for Prof. John Katunich's tutor-training course, Working with Writers.

With the center's research team, I used a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate gender and care work in the center. We presented at the [2023 Mid-Atlantic Writing Centers Association annual conference](https://mawca.org/event-5104732) and Dickinson's annual [Research on Women's and Gender Studies Symposium](https://www.dickinson.edu/info/20157/women_s_and_gender_studies/678/rowgs), and our work was published in a special edition of [*WLN: A Journal of Writing Center Studies*](https://ship.pressbooks.pub/thepostpandemicwritingcenter/chapter/rethinking-gendered-care-work-towards-a-culture-of-care-based-inquiry-in-the-writing-center/).

**Impact Fellow**, Impact Labs

*[Jan 2024]*

I was one of ~30 fellows who [lived and created together in SF for a week](https://www.impactlabs.io/fellowship) around the mission of building technology with a positive social impact :)

 My team prototyped a  digital learning application for students with visual impairments in low-connectivity areas. We presented our project to a panel of founders and venture capitalists.

**Data Analyst**, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia

*[May 2022 - Jul 2023]*

At the Philly Fed, I worked with researchers in the [Consumer Finance Institute](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/consumer-finance) to identify the [long-run impacts of racial housing discrimination](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/consumer-finance/mortgage-markets/larry-santucci-on-philadelphias-racially-restrictive-covenants-and-their-lasting-effects) in Philadelphia.

I supported geospatial data processing and analysis for CFI projects by digitizing hundreds of U.S. census maps from 1940-1990 to build a new spatial data set of census blocks in Philadelphia. Going forward, this will allow Fed researchers to map economic and social data in the city at a highly granular level. 

Our project helped lead to the creation of the new [Center for the Restoration of Economic Data at the Philly Fed.](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/consumer-finance/creed)

**Student Fellow**, Reboot

*[Feb 2022 - Apr 2022]*

I was part of the [tech x race cohort](https://joinreboot.org/p/fellowship-22), where I read Jackie Wang's Carceral Capitalism and wrote a long-form essay on regulating the power of the Google search engine.

**Data Visualization Intern**, Heliotrope Design

*[Jun 2021 - Sep 2021]*

I worked with Heliotrope's lead designer on a [geospatial data visualization](https://dickinsongis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=f2fee3b456be48c488d67ca4dbb0d79b) of racially restrictive housing covenants in Philadelphia using ArcGIS Online, documented the UX flow of Philly Fed data tools using Keynote, and conducted an inventory of 17 public-facing data visualizations and data sets from the Fed to support a site re-design.

**Editorial Assistant**, New Books in Political Science

*[Jun 2020 - Sep 2020]*

I provided research and administrative support for Profs. Susan Liebell (St. Joseph's University) and Lilly Goren (Carroll University), hosts of the [New Books in Political Science Podcast](https://newbooksnetwork.com/category/politics-society/political-science), which reached about 7,000 listeners weekly while I was there. 

I drafted 8 [blog posts](https://newbooksnetwork.com/nicole-myers-turner-soul-liberty-the-evolution-of-black-religious-politics-in-postemancipation-virginia-unc-press-2020) for the New Books Network website synthesizing the content of selected books. I also performed research for the [initial POSTSCRIPT episode](https://newbooksnetwork.com/post-script-a-deep-dive-on-china) on controversial issues in Chinese politics, compiling author biographies and a summary of recent media coverage.
